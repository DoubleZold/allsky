 Important note before usage!!!
  This device requires combined write/read request, which is disabled in i2c_bcm2708 driver by default (tested on Raspberry PI model B+)
  To activate combined mode please run this command as root (not sudo):
  # echo -n 1 > /sys/module/i2c_bcm2708/parameters/combined

 Usage:
 Read IR temp: 
	$ ./read_mlx90614 --bus 1 --i2c_addr 0x2a -i
    or
    $ ./read_mlx90614 --bus 1 --i2c_addr 0x2a --get_ir_temp

	where bus - number of the actual i2c bus in system
    i2c_addr - address of the slave device (0x5e is factory default)
    get_ir_temp - what we want to read
